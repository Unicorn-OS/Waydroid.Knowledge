# Waydroid in Weston nested window
Perfect solution for a Windowed Android UI!

Windowing mode is not yet implemented. In the meantime, you can run "Wayland's Weston" as a window (nested server) on your desktop.
1. run `weston &`
2. Resize it to the size you like, or set programatically (xdo for example).
3. Then click the weston-terminal on top left bar
4. run `waydroid show-full-ui` inside it!
